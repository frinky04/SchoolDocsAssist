# School Docs Assist
A tool that assists in the creation of word documents for school projects, using python.

# Why?
I wanted to make something in python that might actually assist my productivity, or atleast, smoothen my school workflow, this was the result.
I located a slow down in my school work, creating word documents is a pain, then getting consistent formatting on each takes too long, and the thing i personally wasn't a fan of was selecting the file location to save the work, so i created this tool

# How?
Automated folder creation, customisable, template driven, coolness
